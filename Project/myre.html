<h2>Anxiety:</h2>
<p>
A feelings of worrying, nervousness, or unease, typically about imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.
<br><br>
	There are many types of anxiety disorders, but today I wanna talk about just the generalised anxiety. Feeling anxiey is a normal part of life, but people with anxiety disorder often have intense, and persistent worries and fears about everyday situations. Even small things can trigger the feeling those feelings.
	<br>
	The feeling of anxiety often affects daily activities, and are difficult to control. Some may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings.
	<br>
	<u>Anxiety has different symptoms and signs like:</u></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Feeling nervous, restless, or on edge</li>
		<li>Having trouble sleeping</li>
		<li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
		<li>Feeling weak or tired</li>
		<li>Breathing rapidly (hyperventilating)</li>
		<li>Feeling the sense of danger, or panic</li>
		<li>Racing heart</li>
		<li>Tightening of the chest</li>
		<li>Hot and cold flushes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Anxiety sometimes doesn't come all at once, sometimes it builds up little by little without someone realizing it, and sometimes it does end up with having panic attacks or depressive episodes. 

</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>
	An anxiety disorder isn't developed or caused by a single factor but rather by a combination of things. Some people may have a genetic predisposition towards it, but having a family member who has experienced anxiety doesn't mean you'll automatically develop anxeity. Anxiety may develop because <u>one or more stressful life</u> event occurs like :</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Work stress or job change</li>
		<li>Family or relationship problems</li>
		<li>Death or loss of a loved one</li>
		<li>Change in living arrangements</li>
		<li>Stress from school</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Or other illness can also contribute to anxiety like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Asthma</li>
		<li>Diabetes</li>
		<li>Heart disease</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Treatment</h2>
	<p>
		The first step is to see a doctor to make sure there's no other problems causing these symptoms. Once an anxiety disorder is diagnosed, a mental health professional can work with you for the best treatment for you.Their are two common treatments which are talk therapy and medications. Everyone is different, and responds differently to each treatment. Someone may benefit from only talk therapy, while others may benefit from medications, or some may need the help of both.
	</p>
	<h2>Today</h2>

	<p>
		We are currently living throught difficult times during this pandemic. So many changes have come, that some people may be expericening anxiety. Personally I have noticed my anxiety increased tremoundsly. Things have changed so much, I no longer have work, I can no longer go to school, I am stuck at home. I feel like I no longer have control of my life or have any stablity. Aside from that I lost a family member due to covid-19. So my world feels very chaotic at the moment.
		<br>
		There are many different healthy ways to cope with anxiety during these tough times.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Keeping active: Exercising is a huge stress reliever, and although gyms aren't open at the moment we can always exercise at home or even go for a walk or run outside.</li>
			<li>Sleeping: It's very important to sleep. Sleep deprivation can trigger your anxiety.</li>
			<li>Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs: These substances can cause or worse your anxiety</li>
			<li>Stress managment and relaxation techniques: meditation, yoga, visualization techniques can help ease anxiety</li>
			<li>Talking: talking it out, validing your own feelings, and expressing those feelings may help ease your anxiety so it's not constantly run in your mind</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Everyone handles anxiety differently. I personally talk it out with my friends, talking about my worries out loud rather thank keeping it just in my thoughts helps a lot. It's all about finding what works best for you.

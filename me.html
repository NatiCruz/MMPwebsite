		<p>My name is Natalia Cruz. I am 27 years old <br>
		working full time and going to school part time. <br>
		My current classes are Intro to Mulitmedia, <br>
		Intro to Operating System, and Computer Programming.<br>
		I am having so much fun in these classes, and <br>always learning something new. When I'm not in <br>school I am working. I work in a resturtant as <br>
		both a host and a server. I've been in the same <br> company for nearly 3 years. This has been by far <br>
		my favorite job. I started as a simple barista. I <br>
		made so much coffee in my time as well as connect <br>
		with my regulars.

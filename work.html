		<p>My very first project was a selfie raster.<br>
		I decided to use this picture, along with a <br>
		picture of a forest sunset. I chose this picture<br>
		smipling because it was the only picture of me <br>
		with out a filter already applied. The background<br>
		of the forset was because I love the view of nature.<br>
		This project brought me lots of nostalgia. When<br>
		I was about 14, back in 2007, I first started<br>
		using Photoshop. I was editing pictures of my <br>
		favorite band for a blog page, and I did this until<br>
		I was probably 16, maybe 17. Totally an amateur <br>
		thing but it was definitely fun for me. Coming <br>
		back to Photoshop was totally a challenage because<br>
		I left like I forgot everything. This however was <br>
		definitely fun.

		<p>My second project was a vector project. We had the<br>
		option of doing this or with a picture of ourselves<br>
		I decided on this. I wanted to play around with the<br>
		shapes and see what I could create.

	<br>
	<p>This is my unfinished GIF project. The idea to this<br>
		was to kind of to turn the night view of the city<br>
		into a bright, colorful, and animated view.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Audio</h2>
		 
			
	<p align="left">This is my audio porject. This one was a little<br>
		harder for me just because I based it on my everyday<br>
		life. I decided to record my morning routine from<br>
		waking up, to me heading to work, to what I do <br>
		everyday at work. The hardest part for me was <br>
		remembering to actually record. I will admit, I skipped<br>
		a chunk of my job, simpling because I work breakfast<br>
		and unfortunately during this time it was our slow <br>
		season so no fun action. The action starts during <br>
		lunch when I have to host. However I was able to capture<br>
		a preshift conversation between my co-workers and I.<br>
		During this time we usually joke around as much as <br>
		possible before we get hit with our lunch rush. Usually<br>
		after that time I am speaking to customers constantly<br>
		and walking all over the resturtant seating everyone<br>
		and just helping out.
